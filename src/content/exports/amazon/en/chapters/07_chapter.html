            <p class="quote">At a high level, pétanque is not just about technical skill – it's about thinking strategically, reading the opponent and controlling the game's tempo.</p>
            
            <h2>Controlling Game Tempo</h2>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p>Tempo in pétanque is about more than just throwing fast. Experienced tacticians use terrain, length and order of throws to control the rhythm.</p>
                
                <h4>Important Principles:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Always discuss</strong> where the jack should be placed before the end begins</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid playing</strong> two balls in a row without first evaluating the situation</li>
                    <li><strong>Vary the distance</strong> between 6 and 10 meters to force the opponent out of their comfort zone</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Control the Game's Rhythm</h3>
            <p>By varying tempo and distance you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Disrupt the opponent's concentration</li>
                <li>Exploit your strengths and avoid theirs</li>
                <li>Create uncertainty in the opponent</li>
                <li>Maintain initiative in the game</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Psychological Warfare – Reading the Opponent</h2>
            <p>Mental play is an important part of pétanque at a high level. Here are some effective tactics:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Positioning Tactics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Place your balls near or in front of</strong> the opponent's boules to force them into difficult shots</li>
                    <li><strong>Play directly behind</strong> or in line with the opponent's balls</li>
                    <li><strong>Block the view</strong> to the jack to make it harder to judge distance</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Adapt to Your Opponent</h3>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>📋 Advanced Decision Tree: Point or Shoot?</h4>
                <p>At a high level it's about reading the situation and making quick, strategic decisions:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>You lead with 11-12 points</td>
                        <td><strong>POINT defensively</strong></td>
                        <td>Block and limit opponent's scoring chances. Avoid risky shots that could give them big points.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Opponent has shooter with >70% accuracy</td>
                        <td><strong>POINT close + block</strong></td>
                        <td>Place your balls close to opponent's to make shots risky. Force them to choose between shooting or giving you points.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Last ball in mène + you're 2-3 points behind</td>

                </table>
                
                <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Always communicate with the team before deciding. A common strategy is stronger than individual decisions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Team Play – Communication and Roles</h2>
            
            <h3>The Three Roles in Triples</h3>
            <p>In triples, roles are often divided among three specialists. Each role has its specific responsibility and together they form a strong unit:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>1. Pointeur (Pointer)</h4>
                <p><strong>Main Task:</strong> To place their ball as close to the jack as possible. This is called "pointing" or "placing" the ball.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Precision, finesse and terrain observation</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Create points for the team through accurate placements</li>
                    <li><strong>Usually plays:</strong> First in the end</li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Calm, patient and has good feel for surfaces</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>2. Milieu (Middle Player/All-rounder)</h4>
                <p><strong>Main Task:</strong> To be versatile – a player who can do both the pointeur job (placing) and tireur job (shooting).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Adaptability and strategic overview</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Act as link between pointeur and tireur and step in where needed most</li>
                    <li><strong>Usually plays:</strong> In the middle of the end</li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Flexible, decisive and has good game understanding</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>3. Tireur (Shooter)</h4>
                <p><strong>Main Task:</strong> To shoot (hit) the opponent's balls to knock them away from the jack and thus eliminate their point threat.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Strength, precision and concentration</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Clear dangerous opponent balls through accurate shots</li>
                    <li><strong>Usually plays:</strong> Last in the end</li>
                    <li><strong>Specialty:</strong> "Shooting on iron" (tirer au fer) or making a "carreau" (where your own ball stays in place of the knocked-away ball)</li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Confident, focused and handles pressure</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Communication is Key</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The team's success depends on the pointeur creating points, the tireur destroying the opponent's points and the milieu adapting and supporting both roles.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p>To succeed, the team must act as a unit. Communicate clearly before each throw:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is the goal to win the points?</li>
                    <li>Should we block the opponent?</li>
                    <li>Should we eliminate a dangerous ball?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Never let two players throw without consulting each other – the game is quickly lost when communication stops.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Team Tactics in Practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early in the match:</strong> Establish your playing style and test opponent's weaknesses</li>
                <li><strong>When leading:</strong> Play safely and avoid unnecessary risks</li>
                <li><strong>When behind:</strong> Dare to take risks and try to change the game's dynamics</li>
                <li><strong>At end of match:</strong> Stay calm and follow your game plan</li>
            </ul>
