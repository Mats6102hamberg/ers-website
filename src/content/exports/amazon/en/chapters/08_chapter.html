            <h2>Effective Exercises for Solo Training</h2>
            <p>You don't always need an opponent to train effectively. Here are some exercises you can do on your own:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>1. Round Obstacles</h4>
                <p>Place several balls or bricks around the jack and practice placing your ball as close as possible. This forces you to find landing surfaces and develop a fine feel for backspin.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with 3 obstacles at 6 meters distance</li>
                    <li>Gradually increase to 6 obstacles</li>
                    <li>Vary the distance between 6-10 meters</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>2. Band Exercise for Shooting</h4>
                <p>Build a frame with two bands at head height and practice throwing the ball between the bands. This helps you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain a consistent throwing path</li>
                    <li>Control the throw's height</li>
                    <li>Develop consistent technique</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Place the bands about 30-40 cm apart to start with, and gradually decrease the distance as you become more confident.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>3. Hit Landing Surfaces</h4>
                <p>Mark different points on the court and try to land the balls exactly on these points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Draw circles with chalk or use plates</li>
                    <li>Vary the distances: 6m, 7m, 8m, 9m, 10m</li>
                    <li>Practice both rolling throws and high lobs</li>
                    <li>Document how many hits out of 10 attempts</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>4. Assess Your Skills</h4>
                <p>Measure your hit percentage and document development:</p>
                <table>

            <h2>Video Analysis – Record and Analyze Your Throws</h2>
            <p>One of the most effective methods to improve your technique is to film yourself and analyze the result.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>How to Film Effectively:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Place camera sideways</strong> so you see the entire movement</li>
                    <li><strong>Capture the whole body:</strong> feet, knees, shoulders, backswing and follow-through</li>
                    <li><strong>Film in slow motion</strong> if possible (most smartphones have this function)</li>
                    <li><strong>Record at least 10 throws</strong> to see patterns</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h3>What to Look for in the Video?</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stance:</strong> Are feet stable? Does leading foot point toward target?</li>
                    <li><strong>Grip:</strong> Do you hold the ball consistently the same way?</li>
                    <li><strong>Backswing:</strong> Is the swing smooth and controlled?</li>
                    <li><strong>Release:</strong> Do you release the ball at the same point every time?</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow-through:</strong> Does the hand follow through toward the target?</li>
                    <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Do you maintain balance throughout the throw?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Compare with Elite Players</h3>
            <p>Watch video clips of world-class players and compare your technique with theirs. Identify differences and work on one thing at a time. Don't try to change everything at once – focus on one aspect until it becomes natural.</p>
            
            <h2>Consistency Training – The Key to Mastery</h2>
            <p>The biggest difference between amateurs and masters is not talent – it's consistency. A master does the same thing, the same way, every time. Consistency training is about building muscle memory through repetition.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>The Principle Behind Consistency Training</h3>
                <p>The brain learns through repetition. When you make the same movement thousands of times, it becomes automatic – you no longer need to think about technique and can focus on strategy and reading the court.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>How to Train Consistency</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Same ritual every time:</strong> Develop a fixed routine before each throw – same breath, same grip, same gaze toward the target</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on process, not result:</strong> Don't worry about where the ball lands – focus on executing the movement exactly the same way</li>
                <li><strong>Throw 100 balls per day:</strong> Masters throw at least 100 balls daily. Start with 50 and gradually increase</li>
                <li><strong>Same distance, same target:</strong> Train at a single distance (e.g., 7 meters) until you master it perfectly before varying</li>
                <li><strong>Document and analyze:</strong> Write down how many of 10 throws hit the target. Aim for 8/10 before moving on</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Signs That You're Building Consistency</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can throw without thinking about technique</li>
                    <li>Your throws look identical on video</li>
                    <li>You know where the ball will land before it lands</li>
                    <li>You can perform under pressure</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> It takes approximately 10,000 repetitions to master a movement. With 100 throws per day, you'll get there in 100 days – just over three months to mastery!</p>
