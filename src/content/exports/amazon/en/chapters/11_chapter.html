            <p class="quote">Mastering pétanque is a lifelong journey. The rules provide the framework, but it's strategy, psychology and training habits that make you a winner.</p>
            
            <h2 id="strategy">Chapter 11: Strategic Analysis and Tactics</h2>
            <p>The rules describe how you may play; strategy describes how you should play to win. Developing conscious strategy helps you make better decisions under pressure.</p>
            
            <h3>Basic Strategies</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Read the surface before throwing:</strong> Note if the ground is hard, soft, sandy or rocky</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose the right balls for your style:</strong> Material, weight and diameter affect control</li>
                    <li><strong>Place the ball in front of the jack:</strong> First ball 30–50 cm in front of the jack creates a "wall"</li>
                    <li><strong>Play on opponents' weaknesses:</strong> Observe how they throw and adapt your game</li>
                    <li><strong>Be flexible:</strong> Test different tactics depending on the situation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Advanced Tactics</h3>

                    <td><strong>Multi-step terrain analysis</strong></td>

                    <td><strong>Position the jack intentionally</strong></td>

            <h2 id="mental">Chapter 12: Mental Strength and Focus</h2>
            <p>The difference between good and excellent players often lies in the head. Mental strength can be trained the same way as technique.</p>
            
            <h3>Handling Pressure</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Three Techniques:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Breathing and visualization:</strong> Deep breathing and mental visualization help you calm nerves</li>
                    <li><strong>Positive mindset:</strong> A positive attitude makes it easier to maintain focus</li>
                    <li><strong>Routines:</strong> Create a personal preparation routine before each throw</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h3>"Tilt Control" – Resetting After Mistakes</h3>
            <p>When you miss an important throw, there's a high risk that emotions take over. Learn to break the negative spiral:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step out of the circle, start over:</strong> After a bad throw, step out, collect yourself and step in again</li>
                <li><strong>Mental checklist:</strong> Go through Stance, Hold (grip), Angle (arm angle), Length (throw length), Lean (ground slope)</li>
                <li><strong>Backward visualization:</strong> Visualize the ball's path backwards – see the ball come from the jack back into your hand</li>
                <li><strong>Learn from each other:</strong> Discuss throws with teammates</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Focus and Concentration</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid distractions by keeping track of the other balls</li>
                    <li>Develop a ritual before the throw</li>
                    <li>Regular meditation can improve your ability to focus</li>
                    <li>Mental imagery - imagine the throw in detail before making it</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Motivation and Goals</h3>
            <p>Set goals that give direction and energy to your training:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short-term goals:</strong> Hit a certain point ten times (daily goals)</li>
                <li><strong>Medium-term goals:</strong> Improve your hit percentage (season goals)</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term goals:</strong> Win a tournament</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="training">Chapter 13: Training Plan and Development</h2>
            <p>Getting better isn't just about playing a lot, but about playing right. Effective training saves time and gives greater results.</p>
            
            <h3>Effective Training</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Five Principles:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Play regularly:</strong> Three sessions per week is enough if well planned</li>
                    <li><strong>Vary opponents:</strong> Compete against different players and participate in tournaments</li>
                    <li><strong>Play with experienced players:</strong> Train with experienced players to learn their technique</li>
                    <li><strong>Deliberate practice:</strong> Focus on one specific skill at a time</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternate between technique and relaxed play:</strong> During training you analyze, during matches you trust muscle memory</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Analysis and Self-Assessment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Continuous learning:</strong> Document each training session and match</li>
                <li><strong>Video analysis:</strong> Film your throws and analyze your technique</li>
                <li><strong>Performance profile:</strong> Create a matrix of your psychological, tactical, technical and physical skills</li>

            <h2 id="physical">Chapter 14: Physical Training for Pétanque</h2>
            <p>Boule Pétanque is a precision sport, not a cardio or strength sport. Despite this, basic physical training is important to improve throwing technique, increase precision and prevent injuries.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Perform these exercises with light weights or with the pétanque ball itself, with high repetitions, to mimic the low-intensity endurance needed during a long match.</p>
