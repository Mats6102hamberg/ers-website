            <h3>Court and Playing Area</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>International courts:</strong> Minimum 15 × 4 meters</li>
                <li><strong>National/regional courts:</strong> 12 × 3 meters</li>
                <li>Boundaries (lines or strings) mark the court's length</li>
                <li>If a ball or jack completely crosses the boundary it becomes dead</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Starting the Game</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <ol>
                    <li>Teams flip a coin to choose court or starting throw</li>
                    <li>The winning team draws a circle on the ground (diameter 35–50 cm)</li>
                    <li>A player from that team throws the jack 6–10 meters</li>
                    <li>The jack must be at least 1 meter from obstacles and boundaries</li>
                    <li>The same team throws the first boule</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Playing an End (Mène)</h2>
            <p>After the first boule is thrown, the opposing team throws until they get a boule closer to the jack or run out of boules. Then it's the first team's turn again. This continues until all boules are played.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Important:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The team without the closest boule always throws</li>
                    <li>If teams are tied (equal distance), the team that threw last continues</li>
                    <li>Players must keep both feet in the circle until the boule lands</li>
                    <li>Boules are thrown palm down to give backspin</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p>When all boules are played, measure which team has boules closest to the jack. That team scores one point for each of their boules that is closer than the opponent's closest boule.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If Team A has three boules within 20 cm of the jack and Team B's closest is 25 cm away, Team A scores 3 points.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Starting a New End</h3>
            <p>The team that scored draws a new circle where the jack landed and throws the jack for the next end. The game continues until one team reaches 13 points.</p>
            
            <h2>Special Situations</h2>
            
            <h3>Dead Jack</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p>If the jack goes out of bounds or becomes invisible:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If both teams still have boules, the end is void and replayed from the same circle</li>
                    <li>If only one team has boules left, they score one point per remaining boule</li>
                    <li>The team that threw the jack in the void end throws it again</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Dead Boule</h3>
            <p>A boule that goes completely out of bounds is dead and removed from play. It cannot score points.</p>
            
            <h3>Measuring</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Measure only when you cannot see with the eye which boule is closest</li>
                    <li>Use an approved measuring tool (string, measuring tape, caliper)</li>
                    <li>Never use feet or body parts to measure</li>
                    <li>If boules are exactly equal distance, no points are scored for those boules</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Competition Rules</h2>
            
            <h3>Time Limits</h3>
            <p>In official competitions, players have maximum 1 minute from when it's their turn until they throw. Exceeding this results in a warning, and repeated violations can lead to disqualification.</p>
            
            <h3>Etiquette and Conduct</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Stand still and quiet when opponent is throwing</li>
                    <li>Don't walk between player and jack</li>
                    <li>Wait to remove boules until both teams agree on points</li>
                    <li>Show respect to opponents, audience and referees</li>
                    <li>Don't touch or move boules before measuring</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Referee Decisions</h3>
            <p>In competitions, a referee is present to resolve disputes. The referee's decision is final and cannot be appealed.</p>
            
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Pétanque is a game that combines precision, strategy and social interaction. With these basic rules you can start playing immediately. As you gain experience, you'll learn the finer points and special situations that make the game even more interesting.</p>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The most important rule is to have fun and show good sportsmanship. Pétanque is as much about the social experience as it is about winning!</p>
