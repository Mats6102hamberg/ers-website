            <h2>Chapter 10 – Pétanque Around the World</h2>
            
            <h3>Cultural Differences in the Game</h3>
            <p>Pétanque was born in Provence but spread quickly thanks to modern "metal balls". Today there are strong national federations in Germany, Spain and England, and the sport is particularly popular in countries with French colonial heritage such as Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Puducherry in India.</p>

            <p>Princess Srinagarindra introduced pétanque to Thailand in the 1970s and encouraged schools, police, army and civil service to play. Today pétanque is mandatory in Thai military training, and the country belongs to the world elite along with Vietnam and Laos.</p>
