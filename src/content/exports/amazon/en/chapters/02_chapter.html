            <h2>Weight, Size and Material – What Suits You?</h2>
            <p>Competition-approved boules must be hollow metal balls with a diameter between <strong>70.5 and 80 mm</strong> and weight between <strong>650 and 800 grams</strong>. The choice of size and weight is influenced by your hand size, role in the team and playing style:</p>
            
            <h3>Hand Size</h3>
            <p>A smaller hand is comfortable with a ball around <strong>71–73 mm</strong> in diameter, while larger hands can choose <strong>74–78 mm</strong>. The ball should feel comfortable but not too large; you should be able to grip it without straining your hand.</p>
            
            <h3>Weight</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Lighter boules (650–690 g):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide better control and require less force</li>
                    <li>Good for pointers</li>
                    <li>Easier to control for beginners</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Heavier boules (710–800 g):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hold their line better when shooting</li>
                    <li>Require more strength</li>
                    <li>Provide more power in shots</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Hardness</h3>
            <p><strong>Softer boules ("tendre")</strong> absorb impacts and stop quickly on contact – ideal for shooters (tireurs) who want to make carreau. <strong>Harder boules ("dure")</strong> roll more predictably and give better control – excellent for pointers who need precision in the roll.</p>
            
            <h2>The Difference Between Competition and Recreational Boules</h2>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Recreational Boules:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Usually filled with sand or gravel</li>
                    <li>Have a chrome-plated surface</li>
                    <li>Come in a single size and weight</li>
                    <li>Cheap but do not meet competition regulations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Competition Boules:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carefully manufactured, hollow machined</li>
                    <li>Meet FIPJP specifications</li>
                    <li>Available in many combinations of diameters, weights, hardnesses and groove patterns</li>
                    <li>More expensive but offer better balance and longevity</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>As a beginner, you can start with a cheaper recreational set to try the game, but invest in a set of competition boules when you feel you want to develop. A good ball that fits your hand provides increased precision and better feel.</p>
            
            <p>Special junior sizes are available for children.</p>
            
            <h2>Maintenance and Cleaning of Boules</h2>
            <p>Metal balls rust if not cared for. After each game:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Maintenance Routine:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Wash</strong> the balls with warm water and a little dish soap to remove dust and dirt. Dry thoroughly with a clean cloth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lightly oil</strong> with an oiled cloth or maintenance spray – the oil forms a thin protective film that prevents oxidation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Store</strong> the balls in a dry and stable environment in a suitable bag or box. Avoid damp basements.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h3>If Rust Occurs:</h3>
            <p>You can scrub the ball with a steel brush or let it sit in white wine vinegar which dissolves the rust, then rinse and dry. After cleaning, the balls should be oiled again for protection.</p>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> With regular maintenance, your boules will last for many years. Treat them well and they will serve you well on the court!</p>
