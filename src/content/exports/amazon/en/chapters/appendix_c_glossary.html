                <h3>📖 About the glossary</h3>
                <p>Pétanque originates from France and many of the sport's technical terms are therefore in French. These terms are used internationally and are an important part of the game's culture. In this glossary you will find both French technical terms and English translations, as well as technical concepts used in the game.</p>
