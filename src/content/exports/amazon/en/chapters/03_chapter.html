            <p class="chapter-subtitle">Grip, stance and throwing technique</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Proper Grip and Stance</h2>
            <p>A stable foundation is crucial for precision. Stand in the throwing circle with your feet slightly apart, weight evenly distributed and body relaxed.</p>
            
            <h3>Grip</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Let the ball rest in the cup of your hand – the fingers hold the ball in a soft grip and the thumb is not used as a "clamp". The hand should be relaxed; if you squeeze the ball too hard, the movement becomes stiff and the throw uncontrolled.</p>
                
                <h4>Two main types of grip:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vise grip:</strong> The ball is clamped between fingers and palm and won't fall out if you turn your hand</li>
                    <li><strong>Cradle grip:</strong> The ball rests on the fingers and is held in place by angling the hand backward in the backswing</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Stance – Pieds Tanqués</h3>
            <p>The word "pétanque" comes from Provençal "pieds tanqués" – "feet together". Stand with your feet side by side, parallel and close together, for maximum stability. Both feet must be completely inside the circle and remain there until the ball has landed. Your center of gravity should be centered and knees slightly bent.</p>
            
            <p>Many pointers prefer to stand as it gives better visibility over the court; others crouch down ("pied tendre") to get close to the ground. Choose the stance that gives you the best balance and aim.</p>
            
            <h3>Movement and Release</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with your arm hanging freely</li>
                    <li>Make a smooth backward and forward swing where the wrist is bent backward in the backswing</li>
                    <li>Extend the wrist at release to give the ball backspin</li>
                    <li>Try to release the ball when your hand points toward the landing point</li>
                    <li>Keep your wrist stable through release to avoid side spin</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h2>How to Point – Precision and Control</h2>
            <p>Pointing means placing your ball as close to the jack as possible. The key is control of length and direction and reading the terrain.</p>
            
            <h3>Determine Three Points</h3>
            <p>Experienced pointers think about three points:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Jack (cochonnet)</strong> – where the target is</li>
                <li><strong>The Parking Spot</strong> – the place where you want the ball to stop</li>
                <li><strong>The Donnée</strong> – the spot where the ball should land</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important principle:</strong> <em>"Boule devant, boule d'argent"</em> – "a boule in front of the jack is worth gold". The parking spot should be a bit in front of the jack.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Choose Throw Type According to Terrain</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smooth, soft ground:</strong> Roll the ball low</li>
                <li><strong>Hard or gravelly ground:</strong> Medium-high throw</li>
                <li><strong>Very rocky ground:</strong> High lob so the ball stops near the jack</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Execute the Throw</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Aim at your donnée, not at the jack. Make a calm backswing, bend your knees slightly and throw with a smooth motion. Release the ball low for rolling throws and higher for lobs. Let the wrist extend at release for backspin and let your arm follow the throw's direction.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Train Systematically</h3>
            <p>Practice placing balls that land on the same spot every time. You can lay out a handkerchief as a marker and try to hit it. A pointer who consistently forces the opponent to shoot away good boules is doing their job.</p>
            
            <h2>How to Shoot – Strength and Accuracy</h2>
            <p>Shooting means using your ball to try to hit and move away the opponent's boule or the jack. A good shooter masters several types of shots:</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Shots</h3>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Shot Type</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Direct Shot</strong></td>
                    <td>Your ball hits the opponent's boule dead center. You throw a high lobbed boule that lands right on target; requires precision and power.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Rolling Shot (raser)</strong></td>
                    <td>A powerful, low throw where the ball rolls across the ground and hits the opponent's boule from the side.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Shot on the Jack</strong></td>
                    <td>In critical situations, you can aim at the jack to move it out of play or toward your own boules.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Shot in Front of Boule</strong></td>
                    <td>The ball lands just in front of the target boule and rolls into it.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <h3>To Shoot Effectively</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>1. Position Yourself</h4>
                <p>Stand firmly with your feet in the circle; some shooters move their back foot slightly backward to get a more rocking motion. Lower your center of gravity slightly and focus your gaze on the target.</p>
                
                <h4>2. Swing and Release</h4>
                <p>Let your arm swing freely. The backswing is longer than for pointing throws, which gives more speed. When your hand approaches knee height, release the ball by extending your wrist and pointing your fingers toward the target. Try to hit the target dead center for maximum effect. Keep your body still and avoid side spin.</p>
                
                <h4>3. Practice with Tires or Rings</h4>
                <p>Many practice shooting by throwing balls into a tire or ring to improve precision. Place three boules in a row and try to shoot away the middle one; adjust the distance as you become more confident.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Shooting is difficult but crucial. A shooter with good accuracy can turn an entire match around.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Training Sessions with Measurable Goals</h2>
            <p>To develop quickly, you need to train systematically with clear goals. Here are three basic exercises with concrete targets:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Exercise 1: The Handkerchief - Donnée Precision</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Lay out a handkerchief or mark a circle (diameter ~50 cm) at 6, 7 and 8 meter distances.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> Hit donnée 4/10 times at 6 meters</li>
                    <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Hit donnée 6/10 times at 7 meters</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Hit donnée 7/10 times at 8 meters</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Log:</strong> Date, distance, hits/attempts, what needs adjustment (height/power/direction)</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Exercise 2: Three Zones - Distance Control</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Place the jack at 6m, 8m and 10m. Throw 5 balls per zone and measure how many land within 50 cm of the jack.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> 3/5 within 50 cm at 6m</li>
                    <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> 4/5 within 50 cm at 8m</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> 3/5 within 30 cm at 10m</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Log:</strong> Hit percentage per zone, which distance is hardest</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Exercise 3: Shooting Practice - Accuracy</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Place 6 target balls at different distances (6-10m). Try to shoot them away one at a time.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> 2/6 hits</li>
                    <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> 4/6 hits</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> 5/6 hits + at least 2 carreau</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Log:</strong> Hit percentage, distance where you miss most, number of carreau</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Train 2-3 times per week for 30-45 minutes. Document your development in a training journal. After 4 weeks you will see clear improvement!</p>
