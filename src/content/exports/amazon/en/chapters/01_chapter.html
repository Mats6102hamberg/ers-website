            <h2>The History Behind Pétanque</h2>
            <p>Pétanque is a young member of the long family of boules games. In the late 1800s, a game called jeu provençal was popular in Provence, where players took several running steps before throwing their balls. One winter around 1907, the skilled player Jules Lenoir injured his legs and could no longer run. His friend, Ernest Pitiot, solved the problem by shortening the playing field and requiring players to throw while standing still inside a circle. The game was named pieds tanqués ("feet planted"), which eventually transformed into pétanque. The first official tournament was held in La Ciotat in 1910, and the sport quickly spread across France and the world. Today, federations exist in Europe, America, Africa, Asia, and Australia, and the international federation FIPJP (Fédération Internationale de Pétanque et Jeu Provençal) organizes the World Championships.</p>
            
            <h2>Basic Rules and Game Concept</h2>
            <p>Pétanque is played in teams where it can be singles (1 player per team, three balls), doubles (2 players per team, three balls each) or triples (3 players per team, two balls each). The goal is to throw your metal balls as close as possible to a small wooden ball called the <strong>jack</strong> (in French <em>cochonnet</em>).</p>

                <h4>How to Play:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Players stand in a circle with a diameter of 35–50 cm and must keep both feet on the ground until the ball has landed.</li>
                    <li>A game consists of several rounds, called <strong>ends</strong> (mènes).</li>
                    <li>In each mène, one team throws out the jack 6–10 meters, after which the teams take turns throwing their balls until all balls are used.</li>
                    <li>When all balls have been thrown, the distance is measured – the team with the ball closest to the jack gets as many points as it has balls closer to the jack than the opponents' closest ball.</li>
                    <li>The first team to <strong>13 points</strong> wins the match.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Some Rules to Know:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Throwing technique:</strong> The balls are thrown with the palm facing down to give the ball backspin.</li>
                <li><strong>Dead balls:</strong> If a ball ends up in an obstacle or outside the playing area, it becomes dead and is removed from play.</li>
                <li><strong>Approved balls:</strong> Only metal balls approved by FIPJP may be used in competition play; diameter 70.5–80 mm and weight 650–800 g.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Differences Between Pétanque, Boule and Boccia/Bocce</h2>
            
            <h3>Boule – An Umbrella Term</h3>
            <p>The term <em>boule</em> is used in Sweden as an umbrella term for all games where you throw balls at a small ball, but internationally boules often refers to the French category that includes jeu provençal, pétanque and similar games. So it is more correct to say that pétanque is a branch of the boules family.</p>
            
            <h3>Bocce – The Italian Variant</h3>
            <p><strong>Bocce</strong> (sometimes called boccia) is an Italian variant. The differences are clear:</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Bocce vs Pétanque:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Court:</strong> Bocce is played on a longer court with planks (about 28 m), while pétanque is played on shorter courts (6-10 m from the circle)</li>
                    <li><strong>Balls:</strong> Bocce balls are larger and heavier (often made of plastic or wood), while pétanque uses metal balls</li>
                    <li><strong>Technique:</strong> In bocce, players may take approach steps and the ball is rolled with the palm facing up, while pétanque players must stand still and throw with the palm facing down</li>
                    <li><strong>Number of balls:</strong> Bocce uses four balls per player and you can have up to eight players on the court, compared to three boules per player in pétanque (in singles/doubles)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Boccia – Paralympic Ball Sport</h3>
            <p><strong>Boccia</strong> is a Paralympic ball sport intended for people with severe mobility impairments. The game is related to bocce but is played on an indoor court of 12.5 × 6 m with smooth leather balls. You can throw with your hand, foot or with a ramp if the player cannot throw themselves.</p>
            
            <p>Boccia is played individually, in pairs or three-person teams; each player has six balls per round and points are given for each ball that is closer to the jack than the opponent's closest ball. To compare: pétanque is usually played outdoors, with metal balls and requires the player to stand in a circle with both feet on the ground.</p>

                <p><strong>For you as a beginner</strong> it is enough to know that boccia is a parasport while bocce and pétanque are different historical boules games.</p>
